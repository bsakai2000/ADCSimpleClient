# SimpleClient
A single html file provides (nearly) the simplest possible client for https://github.com/AutomaticDoorControl/AutoDoorCtrlWebAPIPHP, which can be used to better understand the requests being made to the API or can be used as a standalone client (albeit one incapable of actually opening doors with bluetooth requests). View requests, return codes, and authorization tokens as they are sent and recieved, with dead simple implementation. This contrasts the real web client, which has unit tests and different components and services and is therefore much more difficult to quickly interpret
